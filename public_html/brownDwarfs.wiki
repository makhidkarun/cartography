Reading through a few papers on the nature of Brown Dwarf stars, I found the following information:

Hydrogen Burning (fusion) limit: 0.075 solar masses
Lithium Burning limit: 0.06 solar masses
Deuterium Burning limit: 0.012 solar masses

Brown dwarf stars, once formed, then burn through their entire supply of Deuterium in 4-50 million years (smaller take longer). Once their fuel supply is gone, they gradually cool.
