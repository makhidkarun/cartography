#summary Format of the variable trade codes to allow parsing.

All of the versions of Traveller have provided a set of "Trade Classifications", a short-hand two character notation attached to each world. These collect a set of UWP values that may be interesting to people visiting the world for trade purposes. 

Stellar Cartographer should be able to generate the entire list of these trade classifications from the UWP, rather than saving them to the XML/database file. 

The trick here is the formulas used for the trade classifications has changes between versions, and even by user. So Stellar Cartography needs a way to allow the user to enter the formula to figure out if a UWP generates a given trade classification. 

The format of this formula is as follows: 

{{{CODE: value[,value]+[, CODE: value[,value]+ ]+}}}

where CODE is a three or four letter short code for the UWP element:
  * port - Starport
  * size - planet size
  * atm  - atmosphere
  * hyd  - hydrographics
  * pop  - population
  * gov  - government type
  * law  - law level
  * tech - tech level

value is one following formats. These use the UWP codes assigned to the CODE, and assumes that the code values in numeric (or alphabetic) order. 
  * N :: a single value
  * N+ :: a single value or larger (higher on the UWP scale)
  * N- :: a single value or smaller (lower on the UWP scale)
  * N-N :: a range of values, inclusive
